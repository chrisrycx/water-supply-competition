This is a repository for scripts and some data used in the Driven Data Competition: Water Supply Forecast Rodeo (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/group/reclamation-water-supply-forecast/).

Note that only the core scripts used for data engineering and model development are included. SNODAS data and some intermediate processing scripts may not be present. Code is for reference and will not run independently.
